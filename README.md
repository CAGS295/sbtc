# sbtc

> Note: This repo is still in early development and is not ready for production use.

This repo contains, or will contain, packages that define sBTC primitives, signer components, helper tools such as `sbtc-cli`.

## stacks-core

At the moment this repo also contains Stacks primitives in the `stacks-core` package. The goal is to make this the default way of interfacing with the Stacks blockchain in Rust. At some point it might be moved to a different location.
